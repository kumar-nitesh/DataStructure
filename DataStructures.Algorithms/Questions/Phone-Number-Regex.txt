Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
Monica needs to scan a collection of documents to look for phone numbers. She is looking at 10 digit phone numbers, which have three blocks. The first block contains 3 digits (the area code), the second block also contains 3 digits (the prefix), and the remaining 4 digits form their own block (the line number).

The area codes may appear in parenthesis. The blocks may be separated by spaces or dashes ("-"), or not at all. For example, here are some sample phone numbers Monica has found:

(555) 412-5122
555-211-8110
5551234567
(230) 4122255
(235)2223333
Write a regex that counts the number of phone numbers in the document doc.

Example

For doc = "Alex:(486)-619-9812, Maria: 632 831 1993, Donald: 232-618-93200, John: 621) 198 1082", the output should be
solution(doc) = 2.

Donald's line number contains 5 digits instead of 4 and John's number has extra bracket between area code and prefix, so there are only 2 valid phone numbers.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] string doc

A string that may contain phone numbers.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ doc.length ≤ 200.

[output] integer

The number of valid phone numbers in the document doc.

[JavaScript] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
function helloWorld(name) {
    console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

function solution(doc) {
  var matches = doc.match("^((\\(\\d{3}\\))|\\d{3})[- ]?\\d{3}[- ]?\\d{4}$");
  return matches === null ? 0 : matches.length;
}
