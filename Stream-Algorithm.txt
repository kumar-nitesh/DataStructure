Note: Try to solve this task in O(n log n) time, where n is a length of the input, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

A streaming algorithm, also called an online algorithm, is one in which the input dataStream arrives one piece at a time. We are going to emulate a streaming algorithm, and calculate the median of all the numbers that have been seen so far.

The dataStream is an array of integers, ordered by the arrival time of each piece. The output will be an array of integers, output, such that output[i] is the median of the entries up to and including dataStream[i]. When finding the median of an even number of integers, choose the smaller of the two "middle" values.

Example

For dataStream = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
solution(dataStream) = [1, 1, 2].

When we have only seen [1], the median is 1.
When we have seen [1, 2] then the median can be either 1 or 2 (or any number in between). Our rule to break ties is to pick the smallest number, in this case 1.
When we have seen [1, 2, 3], the median is 2.
For dataStream = [6, 2, 10, 49, 193, 1], the output should be
solution(dataStream) = [6, 2, 6, 6, 10, 6].

When we have only seen [6], the median is 6.
When we have seen [6, 2] then the lowest median is 2.
When we have seen [6, 2, 10], the median is 6.
When we have seen [6, 2, 10, 49], the lowest median is 6.
When we have seen [6, 2, 10, 49, 193], the median is 10.
When we have seen [6, 2, 10, 49, 193, 1], the lowest median is 6.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)

[input] array.integer dataStream

Stream of some numbers.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ dataStream.length ≤ 50000,
-25000 ≤ dataStream[i] ≤ 25000.

[output] array.integer

The ith> element is the median of the entries up to and including dataStream[i]. When finding the median of an even number of integers, choose the smaller of the two "middle" values.

[C#] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
string helloWorld(string name) {
    Console.Write("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
