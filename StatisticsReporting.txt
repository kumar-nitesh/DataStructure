Array is [2,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,2,2]

Count of Consecutive 2s = 3 // This is not Alpha since count of 2s is different from 2.
Count of Consecutive 4s = 4 // This is Alpha
Count of Consecutive 1s = 1 // This is Alpha
Count of Consecutive 2s = 2 // This is Alpha

4 is Beta, since it is starting from index 4.

Count of Alpha = 3 
Count of Beta = 1

Absolute between the two = |3-1| = 2 (Answer)
