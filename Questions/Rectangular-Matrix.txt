Given a rectangular matrix of English lowercase letters board and a string word, your task is to find the number of occurrences of word in the rows(→), columns(↓) and diagonals(↘) of board.

Example

For

board = [['s', 'o', 's', 'o'],
         ['s', 'o', 'o', 's'],
         ['s', 's', 's', 's']]
and word = "sos", the output should be solution(board, word) = 3.

There are 2 occurrences of word starting from board[0][0](going → and ↘), and one starting from board[0][2](going ↓).

No other occurrences of word were counted, so the answer is 3.

For

board = [['a', 'a'],
         ['a', 'a']]
and word = "aa", the output should be
solution(board, word) = 5.

There are 2 horizontal, 2, vertical, and 1 diagonal occurrence of word, for a total of 5.

[input] array.array.char board

A rectangular matrix of lowercase English letters.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ board.length ≤ 100,
1 ≤ board[0].length ≤ 100,
board[i].length = board[0].length.

[input] string word

A string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ word.length ≤ 100.

[output] integer

The number of occurrences of word in the rows(→), columns(↓) and diagonals(↘) of board.
