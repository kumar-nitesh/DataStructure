A regular game of tic-tac-toe is played on a 3-by-3 grid. The ACME board company is putting out a generalized version of tic-tac-toe that is played on an n-by-n board.

In this variant, players take turns placing an X or an O on the board, and the game ends when one of the players wins or there are no spaces left to play. A player wins if they place a move that satisfies one of the following three conditions:

They complete a row of n of their symbols;
They complete a column of n of their symbols;
They complete a diagonal of n of their symbols. There are only two diagonals on the board that are large enough to win.
You have been asked by ACME to write a function that checks the results of the board. The board is represented by a n-by-n matrix of characters. The cell in row i and column j is represented by board[i][j], and can take the values "X" (if the X player has played there), "O" (if the O player has played there), or "." (if the cell is currently empty).

Write a function solution(board) that takes a n-by-n matrix of strings, and returns the string representing the result of the board. The possible return values are:

"X WIN": The X markers satisfy one of the win conditions.
"O WIN": The O markers satisfy one of the win conditions.
"ONGOING": Neither player has won yet, and there are still empty spaces on the board.
"TIE": The game is over, and neither player has won.
It's guaranteed that there is at most one winner.

Example

For board = ["XO", "X."], the output should be
solution(board) = "X WIN".

X	O
X	
For board = ["XOX", "OXO", ".X."], the output should be
solution(board) = "ONGOING".

X	O	X
O	X	O
X	
Even though an "X" win is inevitable in this game, there is no current winner, and the game is still ongoing.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (cs)

[input] array.string board

Representation of the gaming board. It's guaranteed that there is at most one winner.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ board.length = board[i].length ≤ 100,
board[i][j] is in {"X","O","."}.

[output] string

Return the string representing the result of the board. The possible return values are:

"X WIN": The X markers satisfy one of the win conditions.
"O WIN": The O markers satisfy one of the win conditions.
"ONGOING": Neither player has won yet, and there are still empty spaces on the board.
"TIE": The game is over, and neither player has won.
